Description:
-

The aim of the project is to create a convinient way, using CLI, to write plain mathematical functions, save them in a file, read them from a file and solve them by passing arguments(these functions are just like templates).

All Commands:
-

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `help {the other command}` | Shows brief important notes about the functional commands of the program |
| `show {all, <function id>}` | Based on the second argument, the command shows all functions in the database |
| `add <function>` | Adds a function to the database and the syntax is *f(x,...)=(expression)*, where f can be any letter, the arguments(like x) are also letters, more about the *expression* below |
